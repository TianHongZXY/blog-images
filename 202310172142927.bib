%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Recommender systems are an important component of many websites. Two of the most popular
approaches are based on matrix factorization (MF) and Markov chains (MC). MF methods
learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item
preferences. On the other hand, MC methods model sequential behavior by learning a
transition graph over items that is used to predict the next action based on the recent
actions of a user. In this paper, we present a method bringing both approaches together.
Our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying Markov chains.
That means for each user an own transition matrix is learned - thus in total the method
uses a transition cube. As the observations for estimating the transitions are usually
very limited, our method factorizes the transition cube with a pairwise interaction
model which is a special case of the Tucker Decomposition. We show that our factorized
personalized MC (FPMC) model subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix
factorization model. For learning the model parameters, we introduce an adaption of
the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework for sequential basket data. Empirically,
we show that our FPMC model outperforms both the common matrix factorization and the
unpersonalized MC model both learned with and without factorization.},
